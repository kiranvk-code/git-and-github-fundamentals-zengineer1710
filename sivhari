This is my first time using github for adding, creating branches and making pull request

## Tasks

- [x] Create a branch
- [x] Create a pull request
- [x] Create a readme
- [x] Add relevant data to the readme file


### Review on the course
- I liked this course.
- This makes more people know about vcs using git and remote repositories using github and that is a good thing
